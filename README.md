## Introduction

Sentiment analysis, a branch of NLP, involves classifying text data into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. To build an effective sentiment analysis model, it's essential to start with the right data and ensure it's properly preprocessed. This repository focuses on the initial steps of loading and preprocessing the dataset.

## Getting Started

To use this repository and start loading and preprocessing your dataset, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis-dataset-preprocessing.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd sentiment-analysis-dataset-preprocessing
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dataset

You are responsible for providing your own dataset for sentiment analysis. The dataset should be in a structured format, such as CSV or JSON. Place your dataset in the `data/` directory within this project.

## Preprocessing

The preprocessing steps are essential to prepare your dataset for sentiment analysis. Customize the preprocessing code to suit your specific dataset and requirements. The preprocessing steps may include:

- Text cleaning (removing special characters, HTML tags, etc.).
- Tokenization (splitting text into words or subword tokens).
- Removing stop words.
- Lemmatization or stemming.
- Handling missing data.
- Balancing class distribution (if dealing with imbalanced sentiment classes).

Modify the code in the `preprocess.py` script to apply the necessary preprocessing steps to your dataset.

To run the preprocessing script:

```bash
python preprocess.py
```

The preprocessed dataset will be saved in the `preprocessed_data/` directory.
